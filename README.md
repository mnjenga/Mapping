#Neighbourhood Map

This  is a map that displays technicians and artisans in Nairobi, Kenya with a their skill, Bio and a link to more details on the info display on clicking the marker.  


#Details

The map displays on the side bar a list of all the artisans and technicians and you can use the drop down on the top to filter to a specific category. Once you filter, icons on the map are filtered accordingly, and a search is on on the New York Times of articles that can help with the chosen category  

The project uses Knockout js as the MVVM library which I import into the project by including a link from on of their Content Delivery Networks.  

Further, the project utilises google maps api, and content from The New York Times.  

The markers positions and content are generated with an api call to my item catalog project api located at http://52.58.209.142/ hosted on amazon lightsail
